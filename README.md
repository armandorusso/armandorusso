<h1>Welcome!ðŸ¦‰</h1>

I'm Armando, and I'm Computer Science Undergraduate!

Programming has always been my passion, and I always seek the opportunity to learn. I love programming anything related to software apps and games.

Pinned on my profile are projects that I love and put the most time into.

Currently, I am working on game development in Unity, a custom 3D pixel art renderer in OpenGL, and completing the Tom Looman Professional Unreal Engine Course ðŸŒ±<br>
