### Welcome!

I'm Armando, and I'm 3rd year Computer Science student at Concordia University. 

Programming has always been my passion, and I always seek the opportunity to learn. I love programming games and other software projects.

I've done a few projects here and there, but I pinned the ones that are the most important to me.
